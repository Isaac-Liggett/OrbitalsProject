# OrbitalsProject
This project was to create an accurate gravity simulation on planets in a controlled system.
The planets use concepts of keplers laws and newtons equations of motion. The project was created using SFML library for the graphics and otherwise, everything was coded from scratch. The user is able to add planets with a predefined initial velocity and size of which a gradient colour is applied to the planet in relation to its massiveness.
